# perform_stats

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This collects a set of functions to perform portfolio performance
analytics. I leverage quantstats package in order to build performance
tables but organize the output in a simplified format with less
statistics and graphs.
